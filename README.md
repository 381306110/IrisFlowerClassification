# IrisFlowerClassification
Classifying Iris Data Set through ML

#This project aims at classifying the famous Iris Data Set through various machine learning algorithms.

# Data set source : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

For ease of classification, the flower categories have been given the following class labels : 

Iris-setosa : 1
Iris-versicolor : 2
Iris-virginica : 3

# Running the project

Through OCTAVE/MATLAB, execute the iris.m file.


# Following ML alsorithms have been used currently :

1. Logistic regression : 3 classifiers, each corresponding to the 3 classes mentioned above are trained. Every test sample is then assigned the label of the classifier which gives the highest prediction value for that test sample.
